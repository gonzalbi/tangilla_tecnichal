1.Backend/Config/Index.js
Here you can change the config to run the api server in the port that you wish and the database configuration for the app to be able to connnect

2. Webapp/proxy.conf
In this file you should modify the target atribute with the port that you previously set up on the backend folder

After this you can run the app from the bat or sh file depending the os you are using or from the shell running npm start from the main folder
